# Recursive Java Practice and Maze Solver

This project showcases three recursive programs I developed for CS 46B. It includes a factorial calculator, a maze-solving robot, and a Fibonacci sequence generator. Each part demonstrates recursion, debugging, logging, and managing edge cases like overflow.

## Features

### 1. Recursive Factorial Generator
- Calculates factorials using recursion
- Handles negative input using assertions
- Demonstrates overflow issues with `long`, `float`, and `double`
- Includes a loop that prints 1! to 32! and discusses data type limits

### 2. Maze Solving with a Recursive Robot
- Navigates a maze using a "right-hand rule" algorithm
- Implements recursive pathfinding and backtracking
- Bonus: An advanced escape method handles cycles using robot cloning

### 3. Recursive Fibonacci Generator
- Calculates Fibonacci numbers recursively
- Demonstrates inefficiency of naive recursion
- Bonus: Implements memoization and call counters to optimize performance
- Integrates logging to analyze and disable tracing when needed

## Tools Used
- Java
- Eclipse IDE
- Logging API

## Concepts Practiced
- Recursion and base/recursive cases
- Arithmetic overflow and data types
- Debugging with breakpoints
- Logging and trace-level control
- Recursive problem-solving in a maze
- Optimization using memoization
